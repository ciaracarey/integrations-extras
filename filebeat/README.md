# Filebeat Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Filebeat service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor Filebeat states.
- Be notified about Filebeat failovers and events.

## Setup

The Filebeat check is **NOT** included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Installation

If you are using Agent v6.8+ follow the instructions below to install the Filebeat check on your host. See the dedicated Agent guide for [installing community integrations][2] to install checks with the [Agent prior to version 6.8][3] or the [Docker Agent][4]:

1. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][1].
2. Run the following command to install the integrations wheel with the Agent:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-filebeat==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```
3. Configure your integration like [any other packaged integration][6].

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/filebeat/CHANGELOG.md) for the available integration versions.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `filebeat.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Filebeat [metrics](#metric-collection). See the [sample filebeat.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][9]

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][10] and look for `filebeat` under the Checks section.
